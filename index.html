                    Born in California,transplant to Georgia at 8. I love to dance and play many sports. I am a fan of large
                    gatherings as my wife and I are planning a neighborhood get together. Since moving to utah in the Summer
                    of 2019 I have loved Utah. I enjoy snowboarding in the winter and mountain biking/ rockclimbing in the
                    summer. I just recently got a new job with Dimensional Impact helping with all things in the production of
                    the materials. I look forward to building a long career in programming and my dream would be to work for a
                    game company!

                    Some fun facts: I have summited Mount Timpanogas twice. I was in the folk dance club at BYU and I
                    performed in Christmas around the world in 2015. I was senior class president of my high school. I have my
                    series 7 and 66. I started a shopify store selling womens clothing with my wife a couple years back. I
                    have 3 children under 3. I received my Eagle Scout award by landscaping and restoring an old cotton
                    factory in Georgia.
