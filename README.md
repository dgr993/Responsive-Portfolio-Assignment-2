# Responsive_Portfolio_-_Assignment_2

I really enjoyed this project. I made a website that serves as a home base for my projects, my bio, and my contact pages. I utilized bootstrap most of the time and added a small media query in order to help me achieve the look for my 640px size. My favorite part of the assignment was putting together the card. The reason for this was because it was a big trial and error that gradually got more gratifying as I got more and more right.
